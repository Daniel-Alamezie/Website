			<h2>About us...</h2> 
			<p class="long-copy">
				                    Hello, we're C.E.M.D, a student led group based at Keele University. When the UK Government declared a "climate emergency" in 2019, Keele University was  one of the first universities to join them and stand behind the urgency for change. We followed, creating a group with a vision; making the world a better place by encouraging younger generations to take care of the environment through data visulisation. Afterall, this planet is the only one we've got. Join us to hear more about Keele's efforts in creating a sustainable future.

			<h2>Recycling and Waste Efforts</h2>
            <div class="p1">
            <div id="pic">
                <p><img src="resources/img/cass.png"></p>
            </div>
            <div class="col3"><br>
                In 2010 Keele introduced a dual stream recycling system. Prior to this installation, there was no recycling on campus. Over the years, the recycling rate has increased to 72%. This is important information that deserves to be displayed in a well made graph. 
                </div>
            </div>
            <br><br>
		</div>
        <div id="row2">
        In 2012 Keele built allotments in Lindsay Hall. A polytunnel was installed to lengthen the growing season, enabling Keele to produce loads of fresh produce. When this first began, the food was sold on campus to students and staff, however this unfortunately did not last. In addition to the Lindsay allotments, the Sustainable Student Bungalow was built in Barnes Hall. Four students are chosen to live here and manage the land. Food grown here has also been used to feed faculty, students, and even the Vice Chancellor. All profits from food sold are then used to buy more seeds.

			<h2>CO2 Reduction Initiative</h2>
            <div id="pic">
                    <img src="resources/img/chart2.png">
            </div>
                <div id="row2"><br>
                    The information above shows how and the extent in which Keele is saving money and energy as part of the Keeleâ€™s proactive approach to saving the environment. A lot of lighting projects were taken to switch from fluorescent to LED due to the major benefits such as brighter, longer and energy saving bulbs. Also, the use of smart controlling devices helps save electricity for lighting, heating and air controlling units. Finally, Keele is a campus with many different types of labs and thus lab equipment and with the initiative Keele took to save energy and protect the environment, they replaced inefficient laboratory equipment.
